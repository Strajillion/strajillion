                We've dug deep into technology to build software great software&mdash;every
                Android phone and Linux server built today includes software that we've written.
                But technology expertise isn't enough to build software that <i>matters</i> to people and businesses.
                You have
                to understand users and the value of software to organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's Strajillion&mdash;we use our insight into technology and people to build software that matters.
                We want to bring that expertise and experience to building the software that matters to you.

                Take a look at our product, <a href="https://www.rakkoon.com">RAKKOON</a>, as an example of what we can

            <img class="category-image" src="assets/machine-learning.png">
            <p>
                Machine learning is the future of software and many successful companies use data combined
                with advanced algorithms to drive decisions, automate processes,
                and create value. But the reality is that it takes real world experience to build machine learning
                software that really works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Strajillion has the experience needed to help you use machine learning. We've built and shipped products
                the use text, audio, and image classification to drive key features. Using both <b>custom models</b> and
                third-party APIs such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google Cloud Vision</a>.

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                Primary focus: <b>Linux, Android, iOS, and network security</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team has world- class credentials in computer security.
                We’ve built systems used to secure critical infrastructure (e.g., nuclear power plants), classified
                government networks, the New York Stock Exchange, and countless commercial enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                For mobile
                security, we’ve built secure apps, reversed engineered apps (including working around anti-reverse
                engineering techniques), done extensive penetration testing of devices, and even built a full custom
                Android variant focused on security.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Linux, you won’t find experience of this depth outside of Linux
                distributors and large cloud providers. There is very little Linux security that we have not had
                extensive experience with.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we have deep security experience, we are also developers and, unlike
                many computer security professionals, we can help development teams produce something that is
                functional, reliable, easy-to-maintain, AND secure.

            <h2>Linux and Cloud</h2>
            <p>
                We've done Linux development since distros could be installed from floppies. If it runs on Linux, one of
                us has likely done
                some development around it in the past. That includes native application development, low-level linux
                plumbing, and high-level web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our cloud experience started with the beginnings of DevOps and system configuration management (Puppet,
                Ansible, and libvirt). Since then, we've build scalable cloud systems on private clouds (OpenStack) and
                public clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have extensive experience with <a href="http://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a>, including
                App Engine, Compute Engine, FireBase, and Cloud Machine Learning Platform.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
            <h2 class="text-center">Mobile</h2>
            <img class="category-image" src="assets/app_detected.png">
            <p>
                Truly full-stack development of iOS and Android apps, both native and hybrid.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've built apps using the latest Apple technologies, including Swift and heavy use of auto layout
                (reaping the
                benefits and feeling the pain of API breakage).
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to standard app features, we've explored some of the darker corners of app development.
                Mobile device management APIs on Android and iOS, custom Virtual Private Network (VPNs), "creative" uses
                of background refresh. Need an app that does something the competition doesn't? We can help.
